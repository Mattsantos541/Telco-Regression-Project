-Go beyond the contracts- Contract type is the biggest indicator of churn, but going beyond that with different features to narrow down that group for rish of churn.
-Does price affect ther liklihood of churn?
-Are there features that indicate a higher propensity to churn? like type of internet service, type of phone service, online security and backup, senior citizens, paying more than x% of customers with the same services, etc.?
